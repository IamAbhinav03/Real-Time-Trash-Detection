# Real-Time-Trash-Detection

This is a program that can be used in robots, etc. to detect plastics, trash, etc in realtime. We're collom ecting live feed from cameras installed in the robots. Then we're using Yolo v3 for real-time detection and using coustom object detection to detect trash only. This detection will help to sense trash around and collect it. 

# Datasets Used

For this project we're using Garbage Classification Dataset in kaggle. The Garbage Classification Dataset contains 6 classifications: cardboard (393), glass (491), metal (400), paper(584), plastic (472) and trash(127). This dataset contains You can download the dataset from the link given below
